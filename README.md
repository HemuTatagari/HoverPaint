# HoverPaint

**Description:**

HoverPaint is a single-page responsive website that provides a creative platform for users to express themselves through pixel art. The main canvas consists of approximately 4000 individual square pixels, initially all colored in black. When you hover your mouse over these squares, they magically come to life, each changing into a random and vibrant color generated by the code running in the background.

**How it Works:**

1. **Pixel Canvas:** The heart of HoverPaint is a grid of 4000 pixel squares, collectively forming a canvas. Each square is like a tiny pixel waiting to be transformed.

2. **Color on Hover:** As you move your cursor over the canvas, the squares you touch will instantly change their color, creating a mesmerizing effect. The colors are chosen randomly, making every hover unique.

3. **Create Art:** By strategically hovering over the right squares, you can paint your own masterpieces, be it simple patterns, intricate designs, or just a burst of colors. Your imagination is the only limit.

4. **Reset Button:** To start anew or erase your canvas entirely, there's a handy "RESET" button. A single click will return all the squares to their original black state.

**Key Features:**

- Simple and intuitive: HoverPaint is designed to be user-friendly, allowing anyone to create pixel art effortlessly.
- Responsive: The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Endless Possibilities: With 4000 pixels at your disposal, you have a vast canvas to explore your artistic side.
- Randomized Colors: The magic of HoverPaint lies in its ability to surprise you with an ever-changing color palette.

**Getting Started:**

1. Open the HoverPaint website in your web browser.

2. Hover your mouse cursor over the squares to start painting.

3. Use the "RESET" button to clear the canvas and start a new creation.
